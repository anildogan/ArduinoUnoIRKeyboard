# ArduinoUnoIRKeyboard
Arduino UNO keyboard interaction using IR remote with serial communication with python 

In this method you dont have to change the Arduino firmware, it just serial communication between python and Arduino and keyboard interaction using pynput library

# Usage
    -Uncomment the print line on arduino-source.ino file and change the codes according to the spesific code number
    -Install the arduino-source.ino file to Arduino UNO 
    -Install required libraries
    -Execute the IRemote_control.py file


# Requirements
    -serial
    -pynput
